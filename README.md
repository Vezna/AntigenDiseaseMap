### Known mistakes
Mistakes made when writing this script (I wasn't considering publishing it online, when I wrote it):
1) Czech is used in some parts. Not very international.
2) I was testing some things, so diseases are loaded from textfile "nemoci.txt", but the antigens are hardcoded into the script. I need to change it so antigens are also loaded from textfile.
3) More mistakes were definitely made.

## How to use
1) Open the script folder with processing.
2) Press play :)
3) More detailed usage needs to be written.
